# Circle Projection

Herein lie some experiments with projecting a vector onto a the perimeter of a circle. The reason for this is an attempt to solve the question: if a point is constrained to circle and controlled by the mouse, given a movement of the mouse in a certain direction, how much should the point move around the circle?
